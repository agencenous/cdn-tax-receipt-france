  <description>
      Creates Tax Receipts including single or annual/aggregate tax receipts, with distribution by email or print,
      detailed reporting, press ready PDF template possible. We worked with (and continue to work with) a BDO Tax Partner
      who has strong ties to both the NPO community and Tax Authorities (CRA).
